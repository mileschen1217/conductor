# Benchmark protocol — single high-end inline vs conductor mode

One-shot comparative acceptance procedure (NOT standing eval infrastructure).
Human-governed: the human selects the task, adjudicates quality, and rules
pass/fail — this protocol contains NO automatic pass logic.

## Task selection (human)

Criteria (all required): a real repo; the task spans ≥3 files; subtasks are
heterogeneous; quality is decidable by tests and/or severity-graded review.
The selection (task, repo, why it meets each criterion) is recorded in the
run ledger entry (`task_ref`).

## Run procedure

Same task, two runs:
- **inline side** — one high-end model does everything in a single context.
- **conductor side** — orchestration mode per `doctrine/orchestration-mode.md`
  through one adapter. This run doubles as the audit subject for the spec's
  tiering AC (AC-2) and single-writer audit (AC-10): the conductor side keeps
  a run journal (JSONL shape defined by `scripts/audit-single-writer.sh`,
  derived from the adapter's dispatch records) and feeds it through that audit.

## Ledger — `benchmark/ledger.jsonl` (append-only; one run per line; never rewrite)

```json
{"run_id": "", "task_ref": {"task": "", "repo": "", "selection_basis": ""},
 "side": "inline|conductor", "models": [], "tokens_in": 0, "tokens_out": 0,
 "cost": 0.0, "cost_source": "billing-surface|tokens-x-list-price(<date>)",
 "quality": {"tests": "", "review_critical": 0, "review_high": 0, "verdict_by": ""},
 "artifacts": []}
```

Cost rules: prefer the side's actual billing/usage surface; when absent,
tokens × that day's official list price; either way `cost_source` says which.

## Quality rubric (human adjudication)

Floor: the task's own tests/checks all green. Above the floor: the human
reviews both deliverables and grades defects by severity. **Not-worse** =
conductor tests ≥ inline AND conductor Critical/High defect count ≤ inline.
**Overall pass** = quality not-worse AND conductor $ cost lower. The human's
ruling and identity go in `quality.verdict_by`.

## Acceptance-judge instruction (fixed text — portability parity, AC-8)

Both sides' judges receive this block byte-identical; ONLY the two path slots
`<contract-path>` and `<task-dir>` vary. The judge is fresh-context and is
never that side's builder.

```text
You are a fresh-context acceptance judge. You did not build the artifacts you
are judging. Read the task contract at <contract-path> and the artifacts in
<task-dir> (result.json and every file it references). For EACH acceptance
criterion in the contract's Acceptance Criteria section, judge pass or fail
STRICTLY from the artifacts in front of you — do not re-run the task, do not
repair anything, do not consult any other context. Cite evidence as file:line
or a quoted command-output line. Write EXACTLY one JSON array (no prose, no
wrapper object) to <task-dir>/acceptance.json:
[{"ac_id": "<id>", "status": "pass"|"fail", "evidence": "<file:line or quote>"}]
```

Parity comparison: join the two acceptance.json arrays on ac_id; verdicts
must match (both pass or both fail) for every ac_id. On mismatch: first
rule out instruction divergence (byte-identical instruction = ruled out),
then read the divergence against flip-trigger FT-1 (invocation-semantics
fork → reopen the architecture decision, ADR 0001).
